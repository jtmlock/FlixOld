### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

-Getting Cocoapods to run the Alamofireimage pod loaded in the Init file.
The dependencies that I was adding to the podfile were different from the guide to the Video.
Time used AlamofireImage, and the guide was Alamofire with extra infro for version info.

After I sorted through the version and specific name, I didn't automatically load OAuthSwift, and OAuthSwiftAlamofire. In actuality, I was able to get OAuthSwift working, but not the latter. I then ended up commenting out the dependency.

-I saw a warning about "automatically assigning platform ios with version 12.2"
I as well noticed it was on Tim's video so I was finicky, but happy with moving forward and not being perfect.

- af_setimage not wasn't loading in XCode as I was working with Tim.
I was getting and error, "command compileswiftsources failed with a nonzero exit code."
-Through GitHub I found a workaround:
Workaround: Disable batch mode by adding a user-defined build setting named SWIFT_ENABLE_BATCH_MODE and set it to NO
Source-
[Github Help from User ylin0x81 - Command CompileSwiftSources failed with a nonzero exit code](https://github.com/Yummypets/YPImagePicker/issues/236)

Tim point out I would need to clean and maybe build again- 

What I saw was that earlier when I was working to set Cocoa Pods up Tim, when he was working in the terminal, let me know that his file was on his desktop. I had copied my code to my desktop therefore. 
I noticed that I had two MoviesViewController files in XCode. So I removed that and was back on my path.
